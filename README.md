# Stock Prediction using Support Vector Regression

This project utilizes Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock values based on another parameter. SVR is a powerful machine learning technique that can effectively handle nonlinear relationships between input and output variables.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict stock prices using SVR, considering various influencing factors. By training the SVR model on historical stock data and relevant parameters, we aim to create a predictive model that can forecast future stock values with reasonable accuracy.

## Features

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** Utilizes SVR to build a predictive model for stock prices.
- **Historical Data:** Incorporates historical stock data for training the SVR model.
- **Parameter Influence:** Considers another parameter (e.g., market sentiment, economic indicators) that may influence stock prices.
- **Prediction:** Provides functionality to predict future stock values based on the trained SVR model.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical stock data and relevant parameters.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the collected data, handling missing values and outliers if necessary.
3. **Model Training:** Train the SVR model using the preprocessed data.
4. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict future stock values.
